    "As those of us on the East Coast are wrapping up lunchtime, we observe that 
    Lightning Prime Day Deals, available for a set period of time, usually two 
    to four hours, are selling out but not at a rate that they did last year," 
    Chaudhury said.
    Halfway through lunch, only one of 21 Spotlight deals has sold out, and that 
    was the Samsung curved TV "which sold out just before noon," she said. 
    Analysts also weren’t seeing a huge jump in sales compared with last year.
    By 9:00 AM Pacific time, U.S. Prime Day sales were in line with Prime Day in 
    2015, according to ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce software company that works 
    with approximately 3,000 online retailers including marketplaces like Amazon.

    However, in the United Kingdom Prime Day sales were up 11% year over year as 
    of 9:00 AM Seattle time. Prime Day is occurring in ten countries: the United 
    States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Canada, 
    Belgium, and Austria. It runs midnight to midnight Seattle time.

    It’s possible higher numbers of sales will come later in the day and that 
    those numbers could rise, said ChannelAdvisor executive chairman Scot Wingo.

    "It looks like Amazon has spread out the deals more," he said.

    Whether or not Prime Day makes a profit is somewhat beside the point, said 
    Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst with Moody’s.

    The real winner is Amazon, which will get more Prime members.

    "As Amazon shifts more of its business strategy toward entertainment and 
    digital content, Prime Day becomes a way to not only increase Prime membership 
    but get more of those members to buy Amazon devices like the Echo or Kindle 
    Fire and use them for exclusive Amazon content."

    Glitch quickly fixed

    A morning glitch kept some customers from being able to add items to their 
    carts.

    Amazon issued a brief statement on Twitter following those reports. Judging 
    from the trickling off of complaints, the issue appears to be dealt with. 
    Still, the tech problems resulted in a few missed Prime Day deals. [...]
